					Sparked by an opaque document produced by the TRAI, the debate around Net Neutrality in India has pitted the people and the telecom operators against each other. Some have argued that TRAI's chosen method to receive consultation on the matter was designed to confuse, and have questioned the regulatory body's primary interests (which should be to protect the consumer.)

						&ldquo;Net neutrality creates an open and level playing field that facilitates innovation, adoption and inclusion. The other key priority is the proliferation of an affordable telecom infrastructure. These essential building blocks of the digital revolution are not contradictory and can and need to be synergised.&rdquo;

						&ldquo;Indiaâ€™s policy framework for telecom and the Internet argues for a relaxation of strict net neutrality, even as regulators keep a close eye on anti-competitive practices. The end goal of policymakers and activists should be the same: enabling cheap and quality Internet access to the maximum number of Indians.&rdquo;
