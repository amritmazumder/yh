		Digital technology has promised us comfort and ease, but in doing so it has enabled an opaque network of operators to be in control of practices that affect our liberty and rights. The technically complex nature of these practices have kept these issues from the critical lens of the public.

	<p class='about-desc third'>
		Using the web as a platform, projects from Yellow Hat aim to combine the efficacy of Graphic Design with the interactivity of the web in order to break down the overarching technical processes that govern our everyday lives — such as Net Neutrality, Mass Surveillance, Data Harvesting — into simple visual and interactive explanations.

	<p class='about-desc third'>
		Yellow Hat hopes to become a resource and a framework for designers, educators, activists, journalists and policy makers who are seeking to raise awareness within the digital arena.

	<div class='hat-section'>
		<p class='hat-desc half'>
		Yellow Hat projects are developed by an open volunteer based community. This community comprises of designers, journalists, developers, politicians, artists, hackers and makers of all kinds who collaborate on projects.

		Historically, colored hats have been used to identify different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28computer_security%29#Classifications" target="_blank">sets of people</a> in the context of computer security. We have had White and Black Hats, Grey and Blue Hats, Red Hats, and now we have Yellow Hats!
